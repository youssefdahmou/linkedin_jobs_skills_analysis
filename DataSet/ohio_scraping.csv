A successful candidate will work with their mentor to create an ensemble of machine learning approaches to accurately identify short tandem repeats (STR) in the genome of patients. STRs have a recognized role in several phenotypes including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s disease, myotonic dystrophies, etc. Multiple computational approaches exist that report the presence of pre-determined STRs in specific genomic loci. However, these computational approaches do not reach a perfect consensus of the set of the reported STRs on the same Next Generation Sequencing and Genome Wide Sequencing data. To fill this gap, the candidate will leverage published scientific literature to generate a set of well supported STRs and implement predictive approaches to construct an ensemble for detecting STRs. Further, the candidate will also explore the validity of the approach with business relevant cohorts.

We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.Position SummaryWe are seeking a highly motivated student to join our group for a 10-week long summer internship program. A successful candidate will work with their mentor to adopt, develop, and apply multi-omics integration methods to assess novel molecular determinants of drug sensitivity. In particular, the goal will be to evaluate and build upon data integration methods such as contrastive principal component analysis (Abid, Nat Commun 2018) and DeepDEP (Chiu, Sci Adv 2021) to develop transferable predictive models that take routine omics measurements such as gene expression or genetic variation for the prediction of cell-intrinsic properties (gene dependencies or metastatic potential) as well as pharmacological profiles including compound sensitivities. Training of these models will be performed mainly on in vitro models and should be generalizable to more complex systems (e.g., organoids and primary tumors) based on recent work estimating gene essentially in primary tumors using TCGA-CCLE aligned transcriptomes (Shi, bioRxiv 2022). Critical to this procedure will be the biologically informed exclusion of signals arising from known discrepancies between systems such as stromal and immune components separating in vivo and in vitro contexts. The proposed work will finally leverage in-house molecular profiles to facilitate rapid in silico discovery of novel combinatorial drivers underlying disease progression and treatment response, ultimately having the potential to broadly accelerate diverse R&D efforts. Throughout this process, the candidate will have the opportunity to learn from experienced computational biologists, exercise their skills in bioinformatics, and learn about the process of R&D in an industry setting.Key Responsibilities Research and benchmark supervised/unsupervised data integration methods as applied to gene expression and other modalities from public resourcesOrganize and compile a database of internal and external omics datasets to enable large-scale data mining effortsLeverage integrated omics profiles to translate and generalize experimental findings across cancer models (e.g., cell lines, xenografts, tumors)Develop effective means of visualization (e.g., in the form of dashboards) to summarize and communicate dataset characteristics and predictive model outputsQualifications & Experience Experience in programming with Python or R as well as common statistical frameworks in the corresponding language (e.g., scikit-learn, tidymodels)Working knowledge of statistical modelling or machine learning is strongly preferredFamiliarity with different omics modalities is a plusExperience with data visualization in both static (e.g., ggplot2, matplotlib/seaborn) and interactive (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh, D3) formatsCurrently enrolled in a MS/PhD program in computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, physics, or a similar fieldMust be able to work full-time for the program durationExcellent verbal and communication skills Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases.

In particular, the goal will be to evaluate and build upon data integration methods such as contrastive principal component analysis (Abid, Nat Commun 2018) and DeepDEP (Chiu, Sci Adv 2021) to develop transferable predictive models that take routine omics measurements such as gene expression or genetic variation for the prediction of cell-intrinsic properties (gene dependencies or metastatic potential) as well as pharmacological profiles including compound sensitivities. Training of these models will be performed mainly on in vitro models and should be generalizable to more complex systems (e.g., organoids and primary tumors) based on recent work estimating gene essentially in primary tumors using TCGA-CCLE aligned transcriptomes (Shi, bioRxiv 2022). Critical to this procedure will be the biologically informed exclusion of signals arising from known discrepancies between systems such as stromal and immune components separating in vivo and in vitro contexts. The proposed work will finally leverage in-house molecular profiles to facilitate rapid in silico discovery of novel combinatorial drivers underlying disease progression and treatment response, ultimately having the potential to broadly accelerate diverse R&D efforts. Throughout this process, the candidate will have the opportunity to learn from experienced computational biologists, exercise their skills in bioinformatics, and learn about the process of R&D in an industry setting.Key Responsibilities Research and benchmark supervised/unsupervised data integration methods as applied to gene expression and other modalities from public resourcesOrganize and compile a database of internal and external omics datasets to enable large-scale data mining effortsLeverage integrated omics profiles to translate and generalize experimental findings across cancer models (e.g., cell lines, xenografts, tumors)Develop effective means of visualization (e.g., in the form of dashboards) to summarize and communicate dataset characteristics and predictive model outputsQualifications & Experience Experience in programming with Python or R as well as common statistical frameworks in the corresponding language (e.g., scikit-learn, tidymodels)Working knowledge of statistical modelling or machine learning is strongly preferredFamiliarity with different omics modalities is a plusExperience with data visualization in both static (e.g., ggplot2, matplotlib/seaborn) and interactive (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh, D3) formatsCurrently enrolled in a MS/PhD program in computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, physics, or a similar fieldMust be able to work full-time for the program durationExcellent verbal and communication skills Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases.

WayUp is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to hire top talent.At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.Position SummaryWe are seeking a highly motivated student to join our group for a 10-week long summer internship program. A successful candidate will work with their mentor to adopt, develop, and apply multi-omics integration methods to assess novel molecular determinants of drug sensitivity. In particular, the goal will be to evaluate and build upon data integration methods such as contrastive principal component analysis (Abid, Nat Commun 2018) and DeepDEP (Chiu, Sci Adv 2021) to develop transferable predictive models that take routine omics measurements such as gene expression or genetic variation for the prediction of cell-intrinsic properties (gene dependencies or metastatic potential) as well as pharmacological profiles including compound sensitivities. Training of these models will be performed mainly on in vitro models and should be generalizable to more complex systems (e.g., organoids and primary tumors) based on recent work estimating gene essentially in primary tumors using TCGA-CCLE aligned transcriptomes (Shi, bioRxiv 2022). Critical to this procedure will be the biologically informed exclusion of signals arising from known discrepancies between systems such as stromal and immune components separating in vivo and in vitro contexts. The proposed work will finally leverage in-house molecular profiles to facilitate rapid in silico discovery of novel combinatorial drivers underlying disease progression and treatment response, ultimately having the potential to broadly accelerate diverse R&D efforts. Throughout this process, the candidate will have the opportunity to learn from experienced computational biologists, exercise their skills in bioinformatics, and learn about the process of R&D in an industry setting.Key Responsibilities Research and benchmark supervised/unsupervised data integration methods as applied to gene expression and other modalities from public resourcesOrganize and compile a database of internal and external omics datasets to enable large-scale data mining effortsLeverage integrated omics profiles to translate and generalize experimental findings across cancer models (e.g., cell lines, xenografts, tumors)Develop effective means of visualization (e.g., in the form of dashboards) to summarize and communicate dataset characteristics and predictive model outputsQualifications & Experience Experience in programming with Python or R as well as common statistical frameworks in the corresponding language (e.g., scikit-learn, tidymodels)Working knowledge of statistical modelling or machine learning is strongly preferredFamiliarity with different omics modalities is a plusExperience with data visualization in both static (e.g., ggplot2, matplotlib/seaborn) and interactive (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh, D3) formatsCurrently enrolled in a MS/PhD program in computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, physics, or a similar fieldMust be able to work full-time for the program durationExcellent verbal and communication skills Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases.

WayUp is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to hire top talent.At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.Position SummaryWe are seeking a highly motivated student to join our group for a 10-week long summer internship program. A successful candidate will work with their mentor to adopt, develop, and apply multi-omics integration methods to assess novel molecular determinants of drug sensitivity. In particular, the goal will be to evaluate and build upon data integration methods such as contrastive principal component analysis (Abid, Nat Commun 2018) and DeepDEP (Chiu, Sci Adv 2021) to develop transferable predictive models that take routine omics measurements such as gene expression or genetic variation for the prediction of cell-intrinsic properties (gene dependencies or metastatic potential) as well as pharmacological profiles including compound sensitivities. Training of these models will be performed mainly on in vitro models and should be generalizable to more complex systems (e.g., organoids and primary tumors) based on recent work estimating gene essentially in primary tumors using TCGA-CCLE aligned transcriptomes (Shi, bioRxiv 2022). Critical to this procedure will be the biologically informed exclusion of signals arising from known discrepancies between systems such as stromal and immune components separating in vivo and in vitro contexts. The proposed work will finally leverage in-house molecular profiles to facilitate rapid in silico discovery of novel combinatorial drivers underlying disease progression and treatment response, ultimately having the potential to broadly accelerate diverse R&D efforts. Throughout this process, the candidate will have the opportunity to learn from experienced computational biologists, exercise their skills in bioinformatics, and learn about the process of R&D in an industry setting.Key Responsibilities Research and benchmark supervised/unsupervised data integration methods as applied to gene expression and other modalities from public resourcesOrganize and compile a database of internal and external omics datasets to enable large-scale data mining effortsLeverage integrated omics profiles to translate and generalize experimental findings across cancer models (e.g., cell lines, xenografts, tumors)Develop effective means of visualization (e.g., in the form of dashboards) to summarize and communicate dataset characteristics and predictive model outputsQualifications & Experience Experience in programming with Python or R as well as common statistical frameworks in the corresponding language (e.g., scikit-learn, tidymodels)Working knowledge of statistical modelling or machine learning is strongly preferredFamiliarity with different omics modalities is a plusExperience with data visualization in both static (e.g., ggplot2, matplotlib/seaborn) and interactive (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh, D3) formatsCurrently enrolled in a MS/PhD program in computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, physics, or a similar fieldMust be able to work full-time for the program durationExcellent verbal and communication skills Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases.

291,"Bristol Myers Squibb, Intern, Computational Biology (Summer 2023) - Application via WayUp",WayUp,"This role is with Bristol Myers Squibb. WayUp is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to hire top talent.At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.Position SummaryWe are seeking a highly motivated student to join our group for a 10-week long summer internship program. A successful candidate will work with their mentor to adopt, develop, and apply multi-omics integration methods to assess novel molecular determinants of drug sensitivity. In particular, the goal will be to evaluate and build upon data integration methods such as contrastive principal component analysis (Abid, Nat Commun 2018) and DeepDEP (Chiu, Sci Adv 2021) to develop transferable predictive models that take routine omics measurements such as gene expression or genetic variation for the prediction of cell-intrinsic properties (gene dependencies or metastatic potential) as well as pharmacological profiles including compound sensitivities. Training of these models will be performed mainly on in vitro models and should be generalizable to more complex systems (e.g., organoids and primary tumors) based on recent work estimating gene essentially in primary tumors using TCGA-CCLE aligned transcriptomes (Shi, bioRxiv 2022). Critical to this procedure will be the biologically informed exclusion of signals arising from known discrepancies between systems such as stromal and immune components separating in vivo and in vitro contexts. The proposed work will finally leverage in-house molecular profiles to facilitate rapid in silico discovery of novel combinatorial drivers underlying disease progression and treatment response, ultimately having the potential to broadly accelerate diverse R&D efforts. Throughout this process, the candidate will have the opportunity to learn from experienced computational biologists, exercise their skills in bioinformatics, and learn about the process of R&D in an industry setting.Key Responsibilities Research and benchmark supervised/unsupervised data integration methods as applied to gene expression and other modalities from public resourcesOrganize and compile a database of internal and external omics datasets to enable large-scale data mining effortsLeverage integrated omics profiles to translate and generalize experimental findings across cancer models (e.g., cell lines, xenografts, tumors)Develop effective means of visualization (e.g., in the form of dashboards) to summarize and communicate dataset characteristics and predictive model outputsQualifications & Experience Experience in programming with Python or R as well as common statistical frameworks in the corresponding language (e.g., scikit-learn, tidymodels)Working knowledge of statistical modelling or machine learning is strongly preferredFamiliarity with different omics modalities is a plusExperience with data visualization in both static (e.g., ggplot2, matplotlib/seaborn) and interactive (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh, D3) formatsCurrently enrolled in a MS/PhD program in computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, physics, or a similar fieldMust be able to work full-time for the program durationExcellent verbal and communication skills Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases.

327,"Bristol Myers Squibb, Intern, Computational Biology (Summer 2023) - Application via WayUp",WayUp,"This role is with Bristol Myers Squibb. WayUp is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to hire top talent.At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.Position SummaryWe are seeking a highly motivated student to join our group for a 10-week long summer internship program. A successful candidate will work with their mentor to adopt, develop, and apply multi-omics integration methods to assess novel molecular determinants of drug sensitivity. In particular, the goal will be to evaluate and build upon data integration methods such as contrastive principal component analysis (Abid, Nat Commun 2018) and DeepDEP (Chiu, Sci Adv 2021) to develop transferable predictive models that take routine omics measurements such as gene expression or genetic variation for the prediction of cell-intrinsic properties (gene dependencies or metastatic potential) as well as pharmacological profiles including compound sensitivities. Training of these models will be performed mainly on in vitro models and should be generalizable to more complex systems (e.g., organoids and primary tumors) based on recent work estimating gene essentially in primary tumors using TCGA-CCLE aligned transcriptomes (Shi, bioRxiv 2022). Critical to this procedure will be the biologically informed exclusion of signals arising from known discrepancies between systems such as stromal and immune components separating in vivo and in vitro contexts. The proposed work will finally leverage in-house molecular profiles to facilitate rapid in silico discovery of novel combinatorial drivers underlying disease progression and treatment response, ultimately having the potential to broadly accelerate diverse R&D efforts. Throughout this process, the candidate will have the opportunity to learn from experienced computational biologists, exercise their skills in bioinformatics, and learn about the process of R&D in an industry setting.Key Responsibilities Research and benchmark supervised/unsupervised data integration methods as applied to gene expression and other modalities from public resourcesOrganize and compile a database of internal and external omics datasets to enable large-scale data mining effortsLeverage integrated omics profiles to translate and generalize experimental findings across cancer models (e.g., cell lines, xenografts, tumors)Develop effective means of visualization (e.g., in the form of dashboards) to summarize and communicate dataset characteristics and predictive model outputsQualifications & Experience Experience in programming with Python or R as well as common statistical frameworks in the corresponding language (e.g., scikit-learn, tidymodels)Working knowledge of statistical modelling or machine learning is strongly preferredFamiliarity with different omics modalities is a plusExperience with data visualization in both static (e.g., ggplot2, matplotlib/seaborn) and interactive (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh, D3) formatsCurrently enrolled in a MS/PhD program in computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, physics, or a similar fieldMust be able to work full-time for the program durationExcellent verbal and communication skills Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases.
