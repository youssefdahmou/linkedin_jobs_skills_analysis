"Bristol Myers Squibb, Intern, Computational Biology (Summer 2023) - Application via WayUp",WayUp,"This role is with Bristol Myers Squibb. WayUp is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to hire top talent.At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.Position SummaryWe are seeking a highly motivated student to join our group for a 10-week long summer internship program. A successful candidate will work with their mentor to adopt, develop, and apply multi-omics integration methods to assess novel molecular determinants of drug sensitivity. In particular, the goal will be to evaluate and build upon data integration methods such as contrastive principal component analysis (Abid, Nat Commun 2018) and DeepDEP (Chiu, Sci Adv 2021) to develop transferable predictive models that take routine omics measurements such as gene expression or genetic variation for the prediction of cell-intrinsic properties (gene dependencies or metastatic potential) as well as pharmacological profiles including compound sensitivities. Training of these models will be performed mainly on in vitro models and should be generalizable to more complex systems (e.g., organoids and primary tumors) based on recent work estimating gene essentially in primary tumors using TCGA-CCLE aligned transcriptomes (Shi, bioRxiv 2022). Critical to this procedure will be the biologically informed exclusion of signals arising from known discrepancies between systems such as stromal and immune components separating in vivo and in vitro contexts. The proposed work will finally leverage in-house molecular profiles to facilitate rapid in silico discovery of novel combinatorial drivers underlying disease progression and treatment response, ultimately having the potential to broadly accelerate diverse R&D efforts. Throughout this process, the candidate will have the opportunity to learn from experienced computational biologists, exercise their skills in bioinformatics, and learn about the process of R&D in an industry setting.Key Responsibilities Research and benchmark supervised/unsupervised data integration methods as applied to gene expression and other modalities from public resourcesOrganize and compile a database of internal and external omics datasets to enable large-scale data mining effortsLeverage integrated omics profiles to translate and generalize experimental findings across cancer models (e.g., cell lines, xenografts, tumors)Develop effective means of visualization (e.g., in the form of dashboards) to summarize and communicate dataset characteristics and predictive model outputsQualifications & Experience Experience in programming with Python or R as well as common statistical frameworks in the corresponding language (e.g., scikit-learn, tidymodels)Working knowledge of statistical modelling or machine learning is strongly preferredFamiliarity with different omics modalities is a plusExperience with data visualization in both static (e.g., ggplot2, matplotlib/seaborn) and interactive (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh, D3) formatsCurrently enrolled in a MS/PhD program in computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, physics, or a similar fieldMust be able to work full-time for the program durationExcellent verbal and communication skills Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases.

WayUp is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to hire top talent.At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.Position SummaryWe are seeking a highly motivated student to join our group for a 10-week long summer internship program. A successful candidate will work with their mentor to adopt, develop, and apply multi-omics integration methods to assess novel molecular determinants of drug sensitivity. In particular, the goal will be to evaluate and build upon data integration methods such as contrastive principal component analysis (Abid, Nat Commun 2018) and DeepDEP (Chiu, Sci Adv 2021) to develop transferable predictive models that take routine omics measurements such as gene expression or genetic variation for the prediction of cell-intrinsic properties (gene dependencies or metastatic potential) as well as pharmacological profiles including compound sensitivities. Training of these models will be performed mainly on in vitro models and should be generalizable to more complex systems (e.g., organoids and primary tumors) based on recent work estimating gene essentially in primary tumors using TCGA-CCLE aligned transcriptomes (Shi, bioRxiv 2022). Critical to this procedure will be the biologically informed exclusion of signals arising from known discrepancies between systems such as stromal and immune components separating in vivo and in vitro contexts. The proposed work will finally leverage in-house molecular profiles to facilitate rapid in silico discovery of novel combinatorial drivers underlying disease progression and treatment response, ultimately having the potential to broadly accelerate diverse R&D efforts.

"Bristol Myers Squibb, Intern, Computational Biology (Summer 2023) - Application via WayUp",WayUp,"This role is with Bristol Myers Squibb. WayUp is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to hire top talent.At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.Position SummaryWe are seeking a highly motivated student to join our group for a 10-week long summer internship program. A successful candidate will work with their mentor to adopt, develop, and apply multi-omics integration methods to assess novel molecular determinants of drug sensitivity. In particular, the goal will be to evaluate and build upon data integration methods such as contrastive principal component analysis (Abid, Nat Commun 2018) and DeepDEP (Chiu, Sci Adv 2021) to develop transferable predictive models that take routine omics measurements such as gene expression or genetic variation for the prediction of cell-intrinsic properties (gene dependencies or metastatic potential) as well as pharmacological profiles including compound sensitivities. Training of these models will be performed mainly on in vitro models and should be generalizable to more complex systems (e.g., organoids and primary tumors) based on recent work estimating gene essentially in primary tumors using TCGA-CCLE aligned transcriptomes (Shi, bioRxiv 2022). Critical to this procedure will be the biologically informed exclusion of signals arising from known discrepancies between systems such as stromal and immune components separating in vivo and in vitro contexts. The proposed work will finally leverage in-house molecular profiles to facilitate rapid in silico discovery of novel combinatorial drivers underlying disease progression and treatment response, ultimately having the potential to broadly accelerate diverse R&D efforts. Throughout this process, the candidate will have the opportunity to learn from experienced computational biologists, exercise their skills in bioinformatics, and learn about the process of R&D in an industry setting.Key Responsibilities Research and benchmark supervised/unsupervised data integration methods as applied to gene expression and other modalities from public resourcesOrganize and compile a database of internal and external omics datasets to enable large-scale data mining effortsLeverage integrated omics profiles to translate and generalize experimental findings across cancer models (e.g., cell lines, xenografts, tumors)Develop effective means of visualization (e.g., in the form of dashboards) to summarize and communicate dataset characteristics and predictive model outputsQualifications & Experience Experience in programming with Python or R as well as common statistical frameworks in the corresponding language (e.g., scikit-learn, tidymodels)Working knowledge of statistical modelling or machine learning is strongly preferredFamiliarity with different omics modalities is a plusExperience with data visualization in both static (e.g., ggplot2, matplotlib/seaborn) and interactive (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh, D3) formatsCurrently enrolled in a MS/PhD program in computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, physics, or a similar fieldMust be able to work full-time for the program durationExcellent verbal and communication skills Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases. Empowered to apply our individual talents and diverse perspectives in an inclusive culture, our shared values of passion, innovation, urgency, accountability, inclusion and integrity bring out the highest potential of each of our colleagues. Bristol Myers Squibb recognizes the importance of balance and flexibility in our work environment. We offer a wide variety of competitive benefits, services and programs that provide our employees with the resources to pursue their goals, both at work and in their personal lives.Physical presence at the BMS worksite or physical presence in the field is an essential job function of this role which the Company deems critical to collaboration, innovation, productivity, employee well-being and engagement, and enhances the Company culture. To protect the safety of our workforce, customers, patients and communities, the policy of the Company requires all employees and workers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, unless they have received an exception based on an approved request for a medical or religious reasonable accommodation.Therefore, all BMS applicants seeking a role located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico must confirm that they have already received or are willing to receive the full COVID-19 vaccination by their start date as a qualification of the role and condition of employment.This requirement is subject to state and local law restrictions and may not be applicable to employees working in certain jurisdictions such as Montana. This requirement is also subject to discussions with collective bargaining representatives in the U.S. Our company is committed to ensuring that people with disabilities can excel through a transparent recruitment process, reasonable workplace adjustments and ongoing support in their roles.

We work to unravel the genetic components of common and complex diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, infectious disease, and rare childhood disorders. By identifying treatment options in this manner, we believe medicine becomes more rational, more precise and, well, more personal.At TGen, we are setting a new medical standard where the future of medicine is happening now. We are pioneers in deciphering the story a person's genome has to tell. For individuals faced with a serious diagnosis, our scientists and clinicians have the ability to let a patients' genome reveal its uniqueness in ways that are both powerful and transformative, especially when it comes to treating disease in a precise and individual manner.TGen has had an important and highly positive impact in understanding the molecular drivers in cancer and other diseases and disorders, but more importantly, has been among the world's leaders in applying this knowledge toward the treatment of patients.By strategically aligning ourselves with first-in-class medical providers, TGen provides direct benefit to those patients faced with limited options.A hallmark of TGen is our belief that by utilizing the latest technologies and collaborating with the strongest of partners, we can develop better tools to increase our understanding of complex diseases and to better predict which treatments might be most effective, i.e., one-of-a-kind clinical trials (the right drug, at the right dose, at the right time).TGen's translational approach and our experience at leveraging genomic information in support of achieving more precise and personalized treatments augments your work in ways other institutes cannot.

"Bristol Myers Squibb, Intern, Computational Biology (Summer 2023) - Application via WayUp",WayUp,"This role is with Bristol Myers Squibb. WayUp is partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb to hire top talent.At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are inspired by a single vision – transforming patients’ lives through science. In oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease – and one of the most diverse and promising pipelines in the industry – each of our passionate colleagues contribute to innovations that drive meaningful change. We bring a human touch to every treatment we pioneer. Join us and make a difference.Position SummaryWe are seeking a highly motivated student to join our group for a 10-week long summer internship program. A successful candidate will work with their mentor to adopt, develop, and apply multi-omics integration methods to assess novel molecular determinants of drug sensitivity. In particular, the goal will be to evaluate and build upon data integration methods such as contrastive principal component analysis (Abid, Nat Commun 2018) and DeepDEP (Chiu, Sci Adv 2021) to develop transferable predictive models that take routine omics measurements such as gene expression or genetic variation for the prediction of cell-intrinsic properties (gene dependencies or metastatic potential) as well as pharmacological profiles including compound sensitivities. Training of these models will be performed mainly on in vitro models and should be generalizable to more complex systems (e.g., organoids and primary tumors) based on recent work estimating gene essentially in primary tumors using TCGA-CCLE aligned transcriptomes (Shi, bioRxiv 2022). Critical to this procedure will be the biologically informed exclusion of signals arising from known discrepancies between systems such as stromal and immune components separating in vivo and in vitro contexts. The proposed work will finally leverage in-house molecular profiles to facilitate rapid in silico discovery of novel combinatorial drivers underlying disease progression and treatment response, ultimately having the potential to broadly accelerate diverse R&D efforts. Throughout this process, the candidate will have the opportunity to learn from experienced computational biologists, exercise their skills in bioinformatics, and learn about the process of R&D in an industry setting.Key Responsibilities Research and benchmark supervised/unsupervised data integration methods as applied to gene expression and other modalities from public resourcesOrganize and compile a database of internal and external omics datasets to enable large-scale data mining effortsLeverage integrated omics profiles to translate and generalize experimental findings across cancer models (e.g., cell lines, xenografts, tumors)Develop effective means of visualization (e.g., in the form of dashboards) to summarize and communicate dataset characteristics and predictive model outputsQualifications & Experience Experience in programming with Python or R as well as common statistical frameworks in the corresponding language (e.g., scikit-learn, tidymodels)Working knowledge of statistical modelling or machine learning is strongly preferredFamiliarity with different omics modalities is a plusExperience with data visualization in both static (e.g., ggplot2, matplotlib/seaborn) and interactive (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh, D3) formatsCurrently enrolled in a MS/PhD program in computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, physics, or a similar fieldMust be able to work full-time for the program durationExcellent verbal and communication skills Around the world, we are passionate about making an impact on the lives of patients with serious diseases.

Pachyderm offers a commercial Enterprise Edition and an open source Community Edition. Pachyderm helps customers get their ML and AI projects to market faster, lower data processing and storage costs, and supports strict data governance requirements.Pachyderm is growing fast and still small, so joining means you are getting in right at the ground floor and that you will have an enormous impact on the success and direction of the company and product. Pachyderm has always and will always embrace a ""Remote-first"" approach to growing our team. This allows us to hire a diverse group of individuals across the country (and world!) while giving our team members the flexibility to work from anywhere.

You'll be solving hard algorithmic and distributed systems problems every day and building a first-of-its-kind, containerized, data infrastructure platform.While your primary focus will of course be building the core product, you'll also have direct exposure to users and enterprise customers via our open source support channels. At Pachyderm, OSS user and customer feedback is major driver of our product roadmap and we believe that everyone within the company should experience that first-hand.Pachyderm is just a small team right now, so you'd be getting in right at the ground floor and have an enormous impact on the success and direction of the company and product.

Major contribution to prominent and related open-source projects are a plus or can be a replacement for work experience in some circumstances (e.g. You've been a student just finishing your degree)While it is a bonus, experience with Golang is not a strict requirement. Programming languages are just part of your arsenal and we've found that great engineers have no problem learning new tools. Must have strong communication skills when talking about technical concepts. Our interview process strongly tests for communication as we have a very collaborative work environment where many parts of the codebase interact in complex ways. Things change quickly as our product develops and breaking down major features into smaller and more easily executable PRs is an imperative skill.
